            <p style="text-align: center;"> Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee, 
                who studied and racked many degrees, who is also known as TimBL, is an English computer 
                scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. He is 
                a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford and 
                a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
                (MIT). Berners-Lee proposed an information management system 
                on 12 March 1989, then implemented the first successful communication
                between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet
                in mid-November.
                <br><br>
                Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees
                the continued development of the Web. He co-founded (with his then-wife-to-be Rosemary
                Leith) the World Wide Web Foundation. He is a senior researcher and holder of the 3Com
                founder's chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
                (CSAIL). He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI) and a member
                of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. In 2011,
                he was named as a member of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. He is
                a founder and president of the Open Data Institute and is currently an advisor at 
                social network MeWe.
                <br><br>
                He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server, and helped foster
                the Web's subsequent explosive development. He currently directs the W3 Consortium,
                developing tools and standards to further the Web's potential. In April 2009, he
                was elected as Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences.
                <br><br>
                In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work.
                He was named in Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Important People of
                the 20th century and has received a number of other accolades for his invention.
                He was honoured as the "Inventor of the World Wide Web" during the 2012 Summer
                Olympics opening ceremony in which he appeared working with a vintage NeXT Computer.
                He tweeted "This is for everyone" which appeared in LED lights attached to 
                the chairs of the audience.He received the 2016 Turing Award "for inventing the 
                World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms 
                allowing the Web to scale"
